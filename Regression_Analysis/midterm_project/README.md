## Mid-term project

This folder contains:
* The mid-term project saved as a .pdf file
* The dataset used in the project
* A manual for the mice package in R

Multiple Imputation was the focus of the mid term project. This was
a topic of my own choosing in a Regression Analysis course.

The paper motivates the missing data, briefly explains multiple imputation
and imputes the data using the FCS (fully coniditional specification) algorithm, 
which is the default method for the mice() function in the mice package. More
information on multiple imputation, such as assumptions and advantages, can
be found in the paper.

The dataset contained information on sleep from several mammals. The dataset
suffers from missing values for several observations/variables. Total sleep
was the response variable. Model selection could have emphasized more in the
conclusion. For more information, see the mid-term project paper.
